# WTFjson

~~This package is an approach to use some of WTForms great ideas for JSON API validation.~~ 

**NOTE:** This project was completely rewritten from scratch under the new name **validataclass** and can be found
[in a new repository](https://github.com/binary-butterfly/validataclass). The repository you are looking at only contains the old version
and will be archived some time in the future.

Please take a look at the new project. :)
